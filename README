This is a Somnium Photoshop panel.

I needed a Photoshop panel that mimics my workflow and speeds up my making process. Since I'm also a nerd I gathered all my techniques that I have learnt to this panel.

I have used these techniques in many of my award winning images. Now you can use those same techniques with just a press of a button.


RETOUCH

Tools for retouching like frequence separation, defringe mask, stamp current & below.
• Cleaning Layer - Just an empty layer for retouching. This way layers are consistently named. It's also locked so you won't accidentally move it.
• Match - Make luminosity, saturation and hue check and adjustment layers for matching layer to background (or other way around).
• Combine Documents - Move all other documents that have only one layer to this document.
• Frequence Separation - Frequence separation layers. Two options simple for quick smoothing and normal for better results.
• Defringe Mask - Layer mask edges are often a little bit of. Defringe layer mask can adjust that.
• Fill Empty Areas - If layer has empty (opaque) areas this can fill them with content aware fill quickly.
• Blend If -> Mask - Converts Blend if to a mask so it can be refined further.
• Stamp Current And Below - Stamps Current and below layers. Unlike Merge Visible to New Layer this does not stamp upper layers.
• Stamp Current And Below to Smart Object - Stamps Current and below layers. Unlike Merge Visible to New Layer this does not stamp upper layers. Merged layer is then converted to a smart object.
• Update Smart Object - Smart object is updated to contents below. Works with 'Stamp Current And Below to Smart Object' (needs psb smart object with only one layer).

LIGHT

Tools for handling light with vignette, cookie lighting, dodge & burn.
• Cookie Light - Cookie light means poking light 'spots' to a image. It can be used to rise certain part of images.
• Vignette - Applies vignette to a image.
• Faded and Contrast - Makes contrast faded look layer.
• Dodge And Burn - There are two options for dodge and burn. Using curves and drawing in masks or using neutral grey layer and using dodge and burn tools. Both can get you similar results but are a bit different to use.
• Highlight - Layer which enables you to draw highlights to an image.

COLOR

Color gradings that I have used in my own images. Can be modified easily.
• Previous Color - Sets previous color theme.
• Random Color - Sets random color theme.
• Next Color - Sets next color theme.

FINISH

Finishing touches. Sharpening, noise & export.
• High Pass Sharpening - Make high pass Sharpening
• Noise - Add noise layer. Blur and noise are adjustable as smart filters.
• Save to Facebook - Save image with correct size to Facebook.
• Save to Instagram - Save image with correct size for Instagram
• Save to Twitter - Save image with correct size to Twitter.
• Save in 4K Resolution -
• Custom Export 1 - User definable export button.
• Custom Export 2 - User definable export button.
• Custom Export 3 - User definable export button.
• Custom Export 4 - User definable export button.
• Save Layers - This makes layers animation from bottom to top which shows how editing progresses.

HELPERS

Helper layers to make all parts of the picture more seamless.
• Make All - Makes all the help layers.
• Memo - Makes layer for writing notes.
• Perspective Lines - Lines to check perspective.
• Solarisation - For finding dust spots and composition errors.
