I needed a Photoshop panel that mimics my workflow and speeds up my making process. This powerful panel helps me to get my retouching, light (dodging & burning), color and finishing/export done in less time.


RETOUCH
• Cleaning Layer - Just an empty layer for retouching. This way layers are consistently named. It's also locked so you won't accidentally move it.
• Match - Make luminosity, saturation and hue check and adjustment layers for matching layer to background (or other way around).
• Frequency Separation - Frequency separation layers. Two options simple for quick smoothing and normal for better results.
• Defringe Mask - Layer mask edges are often a little bit of. Defringe layer mask can adjust that.
• Fill Empty Areas - If layer has empty (opaque) areas this can fill them with content aware fill quickly.
• Stamp Current And Below - Stamps Current and below layers. Unlike Merge Visible to New Layer this does not stamp upper layers.
• Stamp Current And Below to Smart Object - Stamps Current and below layers. Unlike Merge Visible to New Layer this does not stamp upper layers. Merged layer is then converted to a smart object.
• Update Smart Object - Smart object is updated to contents below. Works with 'Stamp Current And Below to Smart Object' (needs psb smart object with only one layer).

LIGHT
• Cookie Light - Cookie light means poking light 'spots' to a image. It can be used to rise certain part of images.
• Vignette - Applies vignette to a image.
• Faded and Contrast - Makes contrast faded look layer.
• Dodge And Burn - There are two options for dodge and burn. Using curves and drawing in masks or using neutral grey layer and using dodge and burn tools. Both can get you similar results but are a bit different to use.
• Highlight - Layer which enables you to draw highlights to an image.

FINNISH
• High Pass Sharpening - Make high pass Sharpening

HELPERS
• Make All - Makes all the help layers.
• Memo - Makes layer for writing notes.
• Perspective Lines - Lines to check perspective.
• Solarisation - For finding dust spots and composition errors.
• Skin Checker - For finding skin imperfections.
• Luminosity Check - For finding luminosity differences eg. in dodging & burning.
• Saturation Check - For finding saturation differences.
• Hue Check - For finding tone differences.
• Delete All - Delete help layers group.
• Blend If - Makes blend if helper layer which shows you where the blend if affects

EXPORT
• Save to Facebook - Save image with correct size to Facebook.
• Save to Instagram - Save image with correct size for Instagram
• Save to Twitter - Save image with correct size to Twitter.
• Save in 4K Resolution -
• Custom Export 1 - User definable export button.
• Custom Export 2 - User definable export button.
• Custom Export 3 - User definable export button.
• Custom Export 4 - User definable export button.
• Save Layers - This makes layers animation from bottom to top which shows how editing progresses. You can mark the main layer with # and it will be saved first. If main layer is a smart object it is copied and opened so you can reset eg. lightroom settings.
